                Here are some tips for managing low blood pressure and living a healthier lifestyle:
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-YLuzdexF5oMoLuxjmTqcblaAnAc">
                <strong>Drink Plenty of Fluids</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-OLjydUvkZoGkaOxw9Xucp0ZWnSd">
                Dehydration can cause low blood pressure, so it's important to drink plenty of fluids to increase blood volume and prevent dehydration. Experts recommend drinking at least two liters (roughly eight glasses) of water every day. Your water intake should be higher in hot weather or while exercising.

                <strong>Eat Salty Foods</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-PrL0doKmGoWPVzxRNbscppmHn2f">
                Salty foods can increase blood pressure, so people with low blood pressure should consider increasing their sodium intake moderately to help raise blood pressure. Good sources of salt include olives, cottage cheese, and canned soup or tuna. You can also add table salt or sea salt to your meals, depending on your preference.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-LJzvdtl3Fon5gIx5qxwc6UfWnth">
                <strong>Drink Caffeine</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-GdB8dBKG4onGLix4UHPc1gZGnsw">
                Coffee and caffeinated tea may temporarily spike blood pressure by stimulating the cardiovascular system and boosting your heart rate. However, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider before increasing caffeine intake, as it can have negative effects on some people.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-ZRcJdTCZSorohlxzCcOcM9SvnCb">
                <strong>Boost Your B12 Intake</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-R9azdRUtuoIZGHx29XWclZbVnfc">
                A deficiency in vitamin B12 may cause low blood pressure, so eating foods with this nutrient may help. Good sources of vitamin B12 include meat, fish, and dairy products.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-G4SOd0Rd4ollRXxaLu9ca2iCnph">
                <strong>Fill Up On Folate</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-FHjGd65XKocMkgxhSh3c0CTfnqf">
                A deficiency in folate may also cause low blood pressure, so eating foods with this nutrient may help. Good sources of folate include leafy green vegetables, fruits, and fortified cereals.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-SHNidit1kotYEwx5giTceyRknte">
                <strong>Cut Back On Carbs</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-AntrdcKsqogPfDx1L1ycukHanze">
                Foods that are high in carbohydrates, particularly processed carbs, tend to digest very quickly relative to other foods. This can lead to sudden drops in blood pressure. A low-carb diet has been shown in some studies to help with off-setting hypotension, especially in older adults.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-DhwtdoEbEoUpnyxg9ekc8Siunhf">

            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-XqQed3n4AoyWPFx9jp9cRHBrnNd">
                Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day may help prevent a drop in blood pressure associated with eating larger, heavier meals.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-PS5qdBOVHowNXWxFUtmcpWiNncf">

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-DcRXdgicCoULUhxK2v7ccR7Xnsc">
                Alcohol can lower blood pressure further, so people with low blood pressure should avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.

            </div>
            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-WC1xdflBRoFrJuxkdcIcAGxjnxf">
                Compression stockings help reduce the pooling of blood in the legs and improve circulation, which can help raise blood pressure.

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-MdnGdRHcWobEeJx6RHMcWVsrnJd">

            <div class="ace-line ace-line old-record-id-doxcnI6QmnElZ17xgNpjsIG2YRb">
                Exercise is one of the keys to blood pressure.  Select a low- to moderate-intensity exercise such as gentle forms of yoga, gardening, or any other activity that you can do at a moderate pace.
