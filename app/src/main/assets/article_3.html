            Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, is a condition where the blood pressure is lower than normal. While it is not always a concern, it can cause dizziness, fainting, and even be life-threatening in some cases. Dehydration can lead to a change in blood pressure. In some cases, it can cause low blood pressure. Other times it may lead to high blood pressure.

            <strong>The Connection Between Dehydration and Blood Pressure</strong>

            Blood pressure is the force your blood exerts on the walls of your arteries and veins. Dehydration can affect your blood pressure, causing it to spike up or go down. Low blood pressure is when your blood pressure reading is lower than 90/60 mm Hg. Dehydration can cause low blood pressure due to a decrease in blood volume. Blood volume is the amount of fluid that’s circulating in your blood vessels. Maintaining a normal blood volume is necessary for blood to be able to adequately reach all of the tissues of your body. When you’re very dehydrated, your blood volume can decrease, leading to a drop in blood pressure. When blood pressure drops too low, your organs won’t receive the oxygen and nutrients they need. You could potentially go into shock.

            Staying hydrated is important for overall health, including maintaining normal blood pressure. Drinking plenty of fluids helps the heart more easily pump blood through the blood vessels to the muscles. And, it helps the muscles work efficiently. If you’re well hydrated, your heart doesn’t have to work as hard. Experts recommend drinking at least two liters (roughly eight glasses) of water every day. Your water intake should be higher in hot weather or while exercising.

                Monitor your urine: Your urine color can be a good indicator of your hydration status. If your urine is pale yellow or clear, you're likely well-hydrated. If it's dark yellow or amber, you may need to drink more fluids.
