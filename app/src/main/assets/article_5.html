                Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing from a sitting or supine position. Clinically, this is diagnosed by a sustained reduction in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within three minutes of standing after being supine for five minutes or at a 60-degree angle on the tilt table.

                When you stand up, blood in your legs and feet has a harder time reaching your heart. Thereâ€™s less blood available for your heart to send to organs and muscles. As a result, your blood pressure temporarily drops. Orthostatic hypotension causes may include:

                Orthostatic hypotension might cause no noticeable symptoms, or it might cause dizziness, fainting, confusion, cold and clammy skin, decrease in skin coloration (pallor), rapid and shallow breathing, weak and rapid pulse, and blurred vision.

                A healthcare provider's goal in evaluating orthostatic hypotension is to find the cause and determine treatment. The cause isn't always known. A care provider might review medical history and perform the following tests:

                    Blood pressure monitoring: This involves measuring blood pressure while sitting and standing. A drop of 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) in the top number (systolic blood pressure) within 2 to 5 minutes of standing is a sign of orthostatic hypotension. A drop of 10 mm Hg in the bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) within 2 to 5 minutes of standing also indicates orthostatic hypotension.

                Treatment for orthostatic hypotension is directed at the cause rather than the low blood pressure itself. For example, if dehydration causes orthostatic hypotension, your healthcare provider may suggest lifestyle changes such as drinking more water. If a medication causes low blood pressure when standing, treatment may involve changing the dose or stopping the drug. Other treatments may include:

                    Wearing waist-high compression stockings: These may help improve blood flow and reduce the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Wear them during the day, but take them off for bed and when lying down.

                    Getting plenty of fluids: Keeping hydrated helps prevent symptoms of low blood pressure. Drink plenty of water before long periods of standing, or any activities that tend to trigger symptoms.
